 # Problem 1:
# Write a method that prints out every number from 1 to 100. 
#def print_to_hundred
  #index = 1
  #while index <= 100
    #puts index
    #index += 1
  #end

#end

#print_to_hundred


# Problem 2: 
# Write a method that prints out every other number from 1 to 100. (That is, 1, 3, 5, 7 â€¦ 99).

#def print_every_other_number
    #index = 1
    #while index <= 100 
      #puts index
      #index += 2
    #end
  #end
  #print_every_other_number




# Problem 3:
# Write a method that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter, and counts how many 55's there are in the array.

def array_of_numbers(numbers)
count = 0
numbers.each do |number|
 if number == 55
  count += 1
  end 
end
return count
end 


p array_of_numbers([55, 60, 70, 55])



# Problem 4:
# Write a method that accepts an array of strings and returns a new array that has the string "awesomesauce" inserted between every string. 
# For example, if the initial array is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], then the returned array should be ["a", "awesomesauce", "b", "awesomesauce", "c", "awesomesauce", "d", "awesomesauce", "e"].



# Problem 5:
# Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
# Someone just bought two chairs. Change the hash such that the chair amount is 3.
# The final result should be: {chair: 3, table: 2}



# Problem 6:
# Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
# You received 7 desks to sell. Change the hash to include desks.
# The final result should be: {chair: 5, table: 2, desk: 7}



# Problem 7:
# Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial.
# For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.



# Problem 8:
# Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and prints the sum of every combination of numbers from first and second array. 
# For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should print a list: 101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010].
